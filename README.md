## Description
The Project offers a user-friendly interface for managing employee information. Users can access a list of employees and view detailed information about each employee. The application features several functionalities to enhance user experience, including pagination, employee search by office, employee search by name, and routing using `react-router-dom`. The project is built using React for the frontend, with a separate backend for handling API calls. The sensitive API key is securely stored on Heroku to ensure data security.

## Key Features

- **Separation of Concerns:** The project is divided into frontend and backend components, each in separate GitHub repositories. This separation enhances maintainability and scalability.

- **API Key Security:** Sensitive information, such as the API key, is stored securely on Heroku to prevent exposure in the codebase.

- **React Components:** Modular and reusable React components are utilized throughout the application, ensuring a clean and organized codebase.

- **Routing with `react-router-dom`:** The `react-router-dom` library is employed to enable seamless navigation between different pages of the application.

- **Pagination:** A pagination feature is implemented to display a limited number of employees per page, optimizing performance and user experience.

- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for employees by office or name, enhancing usability and helping users locate specific employees quickly.

- **Styling with SASS:** The application's styling is implemented using SASS, promoting maintainable and organized styling code.

- **Code Readability and Maintainability:** The codebase is structured with clear naming conventions and hooks like `useLocation`, making it easy for developers to understand and contribute.

- **Scalability and Future Enhancements:** The design accommodates future feature enhancements, thanks to its modular components and separation of concerns.

## Motivation and Reasoning Behind Installed Packages

1. **`react` and `react-dom`:** The core React packages are used for building the user interface, taking advantage of React's declarative and component-based approach.

2. **`react-icons`:** This package adds visually appealing icons to components, enhancing the overall design and user experience.

3. **`react-paginate`:** Pagination functionality is crucial for efficient data presentation, improving usability by dividing content into manageable segments.

4. **`react-router-dom`:** Enabling routing with this package enhances navigation, allowing users to access different sections of the application seamlessly.

5. **`sass`:** Utilizing SASS for styling ensures a structured and maintainable approach to CSS, promoting a clean and organized codebase.
