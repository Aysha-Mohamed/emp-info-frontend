## Description
The Project offers a user-friendly interface for managing employee information. Users can access a list of employees and view detailed information about each employee. The application features several functionalities to enhance user experience, including pagination, employee search by office, employee search by name, and routing using `react-router-dom`. The project is built using React for the frontend, with a separate backend for handling API calls. The sensitive API key is securely stored on Heroku to ensure data security.

## Key Features

- **Separation of Concerns:** The project is divided into frontend and backend components, each in separate GitHub repositories. This separation enhances maintainability and scalability.

- **API Key Security:** Sensitive information, such as the API key, is stored securely on Heroku to prevent exposure in the codebase.

- **React Components:** Modular and reusable React components are utilized throughout the application, ensuring a clean and organized codebase.

- **Routing with `react-router-dom`:** The `react-router-dom` library is employed to enable seamless navigation between different pages of the application.
